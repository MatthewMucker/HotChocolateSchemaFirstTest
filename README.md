I'm trying to teach myself schema-first use of Hot Chocolate.

I currently have a 'customers' project in this solution. I plan to later add an 'orders' project.

In the 'customers' project is a customers_schema.graphql file with my schema.

I've implemented (I think?) the schema in the Types folder.

When I debug the project and go to the Banana Cake Pop interface, the host crashes with ` The name `Query` was already registered by another type.`
